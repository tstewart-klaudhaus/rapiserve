# RapiServe

RapiServe is the quickest and easiest way to add AI-driven customer service to any business website.

Major corporations are spending big bucks and months of effort integrating AI into their sites to help convert casual visitors into satisfied repeat customers. With RapiServe you can quickly achieve the same thing at a fraction of the cost.

### Quality of Service

Your RapiServe agent will happily greet visitors and make them feel welcome on your site, helping them find their way around and answering any questions they may have about your products and services. After assisting them with their purchase choices, booking decisions and so on, it will guide them through the sales or ordering process, and when they return later it can connect them with account and customer support information.

### Ease of Use

Unlike other approaches you don't need to rebuild your current website or switch to a whole new host to use RapiServe. It's quick and easy for you or your web designer to add RapiServe to an existing site (whether it's WordPress or another content management system, a front-end app or just plain HTML) by dropping in the provided RapiServe page code and checking some basic configuration settings (which may already be in place).

You can then use the online RapiServe app to give your online assistant a name, review and manage your site map and knowledge base, and make changes and updates whenever you have new campaigns or offers. As you can imagine, being an AI, RapiServe does most of the work for you.

### Live Feedback

RapiServe collects and stores relevant information to help you track your business performance, identify gaps in your product or service offerings and highlight untapped opportunities to respond to customer demand.

You can use the online RapiServe app to get up-to-the-minute reports, explore your day-to-day operating metrics and track the performance of your digital business strategy. And of course, being an AI, RapiServe will assist you with all this too.
